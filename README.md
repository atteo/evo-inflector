# About

Evo Inflector implements English pluralization algorithm based on ["Damian Conway's"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway) paper ["An Algorithmic Approach to English Pluralization"](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/papers/HTML/Plurals.html).

There are more or less half a million downloads of Evo Inflector from Maven Central each month.
It is used by many high profile projects like [Spring and JetBrains](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.atteo/evo-inflector/usages) and [tons of smaller projects](https://github.com/atteo/evo-inflector/network/dependents).

# Usage

The usage is pretty simple:

```java
English.plural("word") == "words"
```

Additionally you can use provide a required count to select singular or plural form automatically:

```java
English.plural("foot", 1)) == "foot"
English.plural("foot", 2)) == "feet"
```

# Features

The algorithm tries to preserve the capitalization of the original word, for instance:

```java
English.plural("NightWolf") == "NightWolves"
```

# Limitations

* The algorithm cannot reliably detect uncountable words. It will pluralize them anyway.
* There are words which have the same singular form and multiple plural forms, ex:
die (plural dies) - The cubical part of a pedestal; a plinth.
die (plural dice) - An isohedral polyhedron, usually a cube

# Tests

As part of the unit tests the results of the algorithm are compared with data from Wiktionary.

There are (2021-07-10) 276574 single word English nouns in the English Wiktionary of which:

- 69.26971% (191582) are countable nouns,
- 27.56839% (76247) are uncountable nouns,
- for 2.8863885% (7983) nouns plural is unknown,
- for 0.27551398% (762) nouns plural is not attested.

Evo Inflector returns correct answer for:
- 96.24286% (184384) of all countable nouns, see [this report](reports/incorrect-countable.md),
- but only for 8.56296% (6529) of uncountable nouns.

In overall it returns correct answer for 69.02782% (190913) of all nouns.
